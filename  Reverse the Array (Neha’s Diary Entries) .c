/*Problem 1: Reverse the Array (Neha’s Diary Entries)
🧩 Problem Story:

Neha keeps a diary of her daily exercise times (in minutes).
She wants to review her progress, but she prefers to see the latest day’s record first.

Write a program to help Neha reverse the order of her recorded exercise times.

✅ Task:

Given n numbers representing Neha’s daily exercise time, print them in reverse order.

🧠 Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing exercise times.
Output Format:

Print the exercise times in reverse order on a single line separated by spaces.

🧩 Example 1:

Input
5
10 20 30 40 50

Output
50 40 30 20 10*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    
    printf("enter the number of days: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    int times[n];
    
  
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &times[i]);
    }
    
  
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        printf("%d", times[i]);
        if (i > 0) {
            printf(" ");
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
