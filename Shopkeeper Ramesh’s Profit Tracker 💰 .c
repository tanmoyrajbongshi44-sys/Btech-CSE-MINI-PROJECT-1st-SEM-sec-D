/*Problem Title: Shopkeeper Ramesh’s Profit Tracker 💰
🧩 Story:

Ramesh owns a small grocery shop in his town.
He keeps a record of his daily profit or loss for a week in an array.

If the value is positive, it means he made a profit that day.

If the value is negative, it means he had a loss that day.

At the end of the week, Ramesh wants to know:

His total profit (sum of all positive values)

His total loss (sum of all negative values, as a positive number)

His net balance (profit + loss, considering signs)

Help Ramesh write a program to calculate these values.

Problem Statement:

Given an array records[] of size n, where each element represents the daily profit or loss,
find and print the total profit, total loss, and net balance.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing profit or loss on each day.

Output Format:

Print three lines:

Total Profit: X
Total Loss: Y
Net Balance: Z


Where:

X → sum of all positive numbers

Y → sum of all negative numbers converted to positive value

Z → X − Y*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, value;
    int totalProfit = 0, totalLoss = 0;

    printf("enter the number of days:");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &value);
        if (value > 0)
            totalProfit += value;
        else if (value < 0)
            totalLoss += -value; // Convert loss to positive
    }

    int netBalance = totalProfit - totalLoss;

  
    printf("Total Profit: %d\n", totalProfit);
    printf("Total Loss: %d\n", totalLoss);
    printf("Net Balance: %d", netBalance);

    return 0;
}
