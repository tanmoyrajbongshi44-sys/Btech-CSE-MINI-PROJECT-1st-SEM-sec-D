/*🧮 Problem Title: The Farmer’s Fencing Problem
💡 Problem Story:
A farmer named Raju owns a rectangular piece of land.
He wants to build a fence around it and also plant crops inside the land.

To plan the fencing and crop area, he needs to calculate:

The area of the rectangle (for crops).

The perimeter of the rectangle (for fencing).

He knows the length and width of the land in meters.
Can you help Raju write a program to find both the area and perimeter of his land?

🧠 Task:
Write a program that takes two integers as input — the length and width of the rectangle —
and prints the area and perimeter.

📥 Input Format:
The first line contains two integers,
length and width — dimensions of the rectangle.

📤 Output Format:
Print two lines:

First line: "Area = <value>"

Second line: "Perimeter = <value>"*/


#include <stdio.h>


int main() 
{
    int length, width;

    printf("enter the length and width:");
    scanf("%d %d", &length, &width);

    
    int area = length * width;
    int perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

    
    printf("Area of rectangle = %d\n", area);
    printf("Perimeter of rectangle = %d\n", perimeter);

    return 0;
}
